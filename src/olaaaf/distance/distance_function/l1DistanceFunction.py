    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : a dictionnary of fractions.Fraction with olaaaf.variable.variable.Variable as key
        The weights of the l1 distance function
    domain: olaaaf.distance.domain.domain.Domain
        The `olaaaf.distance.domain.domain.Domain` on which the distance function is defined.

        Main method of a distance funciton, allowing to get the distance between two points \(x\) and \(y\).

        Parameters
        ----------
        x, y : tuple of olaaaf.variable.variable.Variable
            The two tuples of `olaaaf.variable.variable.Variable` you which to get the distance between.
