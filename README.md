# Olaaaf

Olaaaf is a general adaptation prototype based on belief revision whose long-term aim is to cover a broad range of adaptation processes. It is based on a formalism that covers both attribute-value pairs
(often used for representing cases) and taxonomies (often used for representing domain knowledge).
